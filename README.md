# FFT-Optimization
Implementation of a FFT differentiation algorithm for function optimization.  Given an arbitrary function (here taken as a parabola for illustrative purposes, but the algorithm is general) with noise, a FFT differentiation-based scheme for finding extremal points can be computationally efficient for large data sets and more readily suitable for different types of signal filtering.  Jupyter notebooks available here explicitly deal with harmonic and Gaussian noise sources.
